I would like to express my profound gratitude to all the people and institutions that made possible this doctoral thesis.

First to Dr. Mammen, the director of this thesis and my mentor, for all his support, patience, continuous teaching and great advice. None of all the great things that have happened to me during the last years of my life would have been possible without him.

To Dr. Carri√≥n Ribas, the tutor and co-director this Ph.D. for all his great guidance and encouragement in moving forward this project. Her infinite care and understanding made this process as easy as it could possibly be.

To Dr. Selva-O'Callaghan, great mentor and friend, for introducing me to the fascinating world of myositis, for his wise, and kind guidance along the initial steps of my academic career.

To Maria, for her loving comprehension during not just one, but two doctoral theses. Without her by my side I would not have dared to initiate this project or been able to finish it.

Finally, to Noa. She probably will not remember this period of her life, but without her good character and the boost of joy that she gives me every morning, doing this Ph.D. would have been infinitely more complicated.
