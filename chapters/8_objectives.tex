\section{Motivation}
The inflammatory myopathies are a heterogeneous family of rare diseases affecting multiple organs and systems, including the muscle, skin, lung, and/or the joints.  Accurately defining its pathogenesis and to classify them correctly are key for understanding and managing these diseases.

\section{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define which are the most important pathogenic pathways and the specific expression profiles in the muscle tissue of patients with different types of myositis
	\item To develop a research framework to study longitudinal cohorts of specific myositis subgroups. With this framework we will:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Determine if the autoantibodies are superior to current clinical classification systems to predict the phenotype of patients with myositis.
		\item Precisely define the characteristic clinical features, prognosis and response to therapy of patients with different myositis autoantibodies.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
